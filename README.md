Bandify is an application that lets people all around the world record their own music and combine it with other recordings, even created from other people, to create their own jam sessions.

The app is essentially a track recording tool where people can record a voice, instrument or why not a electronic music track. Imagine an expert guitar player without a band that sucks at singing and writing lyrics. He, or she, has just finished a cool song and uploads it to the service. A topnotch singer and songwriter hears the guitar and comes up with and records an awesome voice track. Maybe a skilled drum player gets in on the action.

Create your own jam session today with Bandify!
